The Chat Bot using Wikipedia API is a conversational bot that uses the Wikipedia API to deliver information on a variety of topics. To begin, clone the repository to your own system and use pip to install the necessary components. Then, execute the chat bot script, and it will greet you and respond to your questions. Simply write your query into the chat box, and the bot will use the Wikipedia API to retrieve relevant information from Wikipedia pages. You may either ask more questions to prolong the conversation or hit "exit" to terminate it. The chat bot has a basic text-based interface and responds quickly and accurately using Wikipedia. Keep in mind that the bot requires internet access in order to retrieve information from Wikipedia.
